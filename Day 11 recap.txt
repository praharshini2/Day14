Recap 11
=====

1. What is operator overloading 
overloading an operator to act like a method
 
2. Why operator overloading
so that we can use operators with objects we overload them
 
3. Syntax of the declaration to overload an + operator
public static ClassName operator +(parameters)
{
 
}
4. Why should we declare the overload method as static
so that we can call them without an object
 
5. What is a delegate
delegate is an C# program
which can refer to any function , function pointers
 
6. Why Delegate
Based on the event. A delegate should be able to execute the respective function
 
7. Create a delegate for the following method
public void SayHello(string name);
public delegate void MyDelegate(string s)
 
8. Steps to work with a delegate
Create a delegate
Create an object of delegate
Invoke or execute the function using delegate
 
9. Two different ways to execute a delegate
obj.Invoke(10,20)
obj(10,20)
 
10. What is multicast delegate
if one object of a delegate can execute multiple functions
 
11. How to create a multicast
obj += new MyDelegate(Substract)
 
12. Delegates belong to which Namespace
System
 
13. when to use a delegate
Event driven programming
Call Back functions
 
14. what is an event 
Action performed by user on the screen
 
15. what is an event handler
Code that executes in response to an event
 
16. What is event driven programming 
Code executes only and only when event occurs
 
17. What is an Anonymous method
function without a name is anonymous
 
MyDelegate obj = delegate(int a,int b){
return a+b;
}
18. What is an Lambda Expression
short cut version of functions
mostly we lamdba expression as paramters to a function
 
19. What is goes to operator
 
goes to operator in used in lamdba expression
it separates parameters from the body of the expression
called arrow in other languages
MyDelegate obj = delegate(int a,int b) => a+b;
 
20. What is LINQ
Language Integrates query
 
21. Why LINQ
To querying, it can query any datasource
 
22. Two ways to work with LINQ
query
methods
 
23. Which Namespace is used for LINQ
using System.Linq;
 
24. Return type of Linq query or an Linq method 
IEnumerable<Employee>
IEnumerable<int>
IEnmerable<string>
 
 
25. what if your query return only single value how to write a linq query or linq method
Single();
Employee emp = empList.Where(e => e.Empid == id).Single();
 
26. write a linq query to display all the employees who belong to department Sales
var result = from a in EmpList
		where a.Department == "Sales"
		select a;
27. write a linq method to display all the employees who belong to department Sales
IEnumerable<Employee> result = EmpList.Select(e => e.Department == "Sales");
 
28. What is a predicate
Predicate Generic type of delegate which takes input and return true or false
29. What is Array.Find 
Built in method of Arrayclass
And it returns the first match from the array
 
30. Syntax of Array.Find using predicate
 
Employee rahul = Array.Find(EmpList,PredicateMethod);
 
public bool PredicateMethod(Employee emp)
{
return emp.EmpName == "Rahul";
}
 
31.Syntax of Array.Find using anonymous
 
Employee rahul = Array.Find(EmpList,(Employee emp)
{
return emp.EmpName == "Rahul";
});
 
32. Syntax of Array.Find using lamdba
Employee rahul = Array.Find(EmpList,(Employee emp) =>emp.EmpName == "Rahul");
